# GeoImageOntology
GeoImageOntology is an ontology of Geological Imagistic Knowledge based on the Information Artifact Ontology (https://github.com/information-artifact-ontology/IAO). We intend to organize the diffent types of images that are used during the Oil E&P. The main idea is to separate the type of the image from the content which it is representing.

The ontology is under development, therefore there is no stable version released yet.
